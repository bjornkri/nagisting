# Instructions

This should get you going, but be warned that the code is not very generic or reusable in its current state.

* Update the settings file to point to your drafts and published folder, and your webroot.

* Add a symbolic link to the index.php file in the webroot.

* Add a 404.php to the webroot.

* Update the index.php file to set the name and structure of your site.

* Update the hops/blogpost.py file to generate your headers and RSS footers how you want them.

* Set up rewrites, for instance:

	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteBase /

	RewriteRule ^([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9a-z\-]+)/$ /index.php?year=$1&month=$2&day=$3&slug=$4 [L]
	RewriteRule ^([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/$ /index.php?year=$1&month=$2 [L]
	RewriteRule ^drafts/([0-9a-z\-]+)/$ /index.php?draft=1&slug=$1 [L]

* Set up a crontab to run brew.py at regular intervals.
